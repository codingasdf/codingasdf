# Hello World 👋

Hi, I'm Coding Slime, a developer from China.

On May 26, 2023, a day worth commemorating, I joined GitHub community and contributed my first piece of code.

The resources in the open-source field are rich and colorful, and the open-source spirit of the people here is truly admirable.

I hope I can learn more in the community, and I also hope to make more contributions in the open-source field.

Thank you all.
